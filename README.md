## wknapp.com source code

### William H. Knapp III

This github repository contains nearly all the source code and files that
I used to create wknapp.com. Notable absences are:

1. private.php
  * Contains information about connecting to the database I used.
  * Contains my private email address used for emailing myself about
    errors or emailing users.
  * Contains a function to test whether the user is an administrator.
2. testfuncs.php
  * Contains test code that I'm working on to add additional functionality
    or information to the site. When this code is solid, it is used to
    update wknappfuncs.php.
3. mailform.php
  * Contains my private email used in my anonymous mailform.
4. protected/pages/homework
  * Contains the questions and *answers* for homework.
5. protected/pages/tests
  * Contains the questions and *answers* for tests.
